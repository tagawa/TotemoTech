### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on July 4th, 2024. In today's news, we have some interesting stories to cover. First up, researchers from Stanford University and Tufts University published a paper in 2016 revealing unexpected patterns in the appearance of prime numbers. Contrary to the belief that prime numbers are random, they discovered a certain bias in their occurrence.

Next, at the 'Contents Tokyo' event, which brings together publishing companies, IP holders, visual and CG experts, and cutting-edge technology companies, a unique voice conversion software caught our attention. Developed by a company, this software allows users to transform their voices in real-time without the need for a GPU, resulting in ultra-low latency. It was quite a surprise to hear a voice resembling that of a young girl coming from a booth, only to discover that it was actually an older man with a buzz cut.

Moving on, let's talk about the Osaka-Kansai Expo's 'Construction Tour.' Participants were recently informed of strict photography restrictions, preventing them from taking their own pictures during the tour. When asked about the reasoning behind this change, the tour organizer, Japan Travel, stated that it was not due to their own convenience, refuting claims that it was solely for the Expo's benefit.

In other news, the Kyoto Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced that approximately 41,819 pieces of confidential information were leaked due to a ransomware attack on their contractor, Iseto. So far, no reports of damages from member companies have been received.

Additionally, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department has initiated a free-of-charge retrieval program for coil guns, also known as electromagnetic guns, following the implementation of stricter regulations on firearms by the revised Firearms and Swords Control Law. Owners of coil guns are encouraged to submit their disposal requests within the designated period.

On a lighter note, Glico, the confectionery company, has resumed the shipment of some of its chilled products that were previously halted due to a system failure. The popular 'Pucchin Pudding' series, including the 'Chokotto Pucchin Pudding,' will gradually return to store shelves starting from July 16th.

Lastly, the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry's Innovation Leaders Summit Executive Committee, in collaboration with the Ministry, has released a ranking of large corporations that actively engage in collaboration with startups. Topping the list is a well-known telecommunications provider that demonstrates a strong commitment to open innovation and cooperation with external talent to foster innovation.

That wraps up today's news. Stay tuned for more updates from TotemoTech.   Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
