Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on July 15th, 2024. In today's news, the anime 'Shikanokonokono' is making waves as the surprise hit of the summer season. With its catchy theme song, the show has captured the attention of fans and is quickly becoming a fan favorite.

Next, Nikon has released the highly anticipated 'Z6III' camera, which boasts improved autofocus capabilities and a high-quality viewfinder. This new model is a significant upgrade from its predecessor and is sure to impress photography enthusiasts.

Moving on, the renowned Japanese electric guitar manufacturer 'Fernandes' has announced its bankruptcy. With a history dating back to 1979, Fernandes was known for its high-quality electric guitars and artist collaborations. This news comes as a shock to the music industry and fans of the brand.

In the world of finance, the importance of effective accounting and financial management is highlighted at the 'Digital Strategy EXPO 2024 Summer' event. One of the speakers, Mr. Kiyoho Nakata, a certified public accountant and the head of the Japan CFO Association, emphasizes the role of accounting in facilitating rational business decisions.

As summer temperatures continue to rise, portable coolers have become essential. We tested the battery-powered 'Compact Cooler' by Yamazen, which promises to cool any room without the need for installation. Find out how well it performed in our review.

In a surprising turn of events, the popularity of the anime 'Shikanokonokono' has sparked a nationwide interest in deer. Even Google searches have seen an increase in deer-related queries. Could this be the start of a deer boom in Japan?

Lastly, Cainz, a home improvement retailer, has issued a voluntary recall for their 'Circulator' fans, which were released earlier this year. Several incidents of the fans catching fire during use have been reported, prompting the company to urge customers to immediately stop using the product.
