Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on June 7th, 2024. In our first news story, SpaceX, the American aerospace manufacturer, achieved a significant milestone with its giant spacecraft, Starship. On June 6th, Starship successfully completed its fourth launch and return to Earth. Despite encountering some troubles during the mission, including the loss of heat-resistant tiles and flap malfunctions, Starship managed to safely splashdown. This success marks a major step forward in the development of reusable giant spacecraft.

Moving on to our next story, Rakusuru, a company specializing in printing and marketing support services, has announced a new service called 'Maru-nage Shukatsu' or 'Easy Throw Marketing.' This service aims to assist businesses with video and web advertising by offering two types of services: 'Maru-nage On-site Video' for 50,000 yen, which provides a 15-second promotional video created on-site and delivered within four hours, and 'Maru-nage Web Advertising' for 11,000 yen.

In another news story, the operator of a specialized voyeurism website called 'Densha Taimen Panchira Kenkyujo' or 'Train Face-to-Face Panty Research Institute' has been re-arrested by the Hyogo Prefectural Police. The suspect, Masanori Ohashi, a 34-year-old delivery business owner from Tokushige, Midori Ward, Nagoya, is accused of secretly filming and stealing a woman's underwear on a train, then uploading the footage to his own video-sharing site. The police have charged him with violating the Act on Punishment of the Recording of Sexually Explicit Conducts, and he is reportedly remaining silent during the investigation.

Moving on, Elon Musk, the owner of X, has shown concern about Japan's declining birthrate. In response to a post by an overseas X user, Musk expressed his worries about the possibility of Japan's disappearance due to its low birthrate.

In a surprising turn of events, Super Print, a printing company known for business card printing, has announced that it is facing difficulties in continuing its operations. The cause of this predicament lies in the conflict between the company's headquarters in Japan and its subsidiary in South Korea. Currently, the Japanese headquarters has been completely locked out of all systems, including production and servers.

Lastly, the Japan Meteorological Agency has experienced a malfunction in its underwater earthquake observation system, which could potentially delay the issuance of emergency earthquake alerts by up to 13 seconds. This delay is due to the technical issues with the system.
