Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on September 12th, 2024. Canon has made headlines with the announcement of its latest digital cinema camera, the EOS C80, which features a 6K full-frame sensor and high-precision autofocus, designed to support single-operator shooting. This new addition to the CINEMA EOS SYSTEM is set to launch in early November, with a retail price of 896,500 yen. 

In the world of manga, KADOKAWA has revealed that the popular series 'Tsundere Villainess Lieselotte and Commentator Endo-kun' will be concluding due to actions by the editorial team that compromised trust, including unauthorized and unsupervised distribution of the comic in a vertical reading format. 

Meanwhile, Hakusensha's official 'Berserk' account has issued a warning regarding the production of an unauthorized anime adaptation, urging readers to be cautious. This news has sparked discussions among fans about the implications of fan-made projects in the manga and anime industry. 

In logistics, Yamato Transport has announced expected delays in deliveries due to the suspension of some operations by JR Freight, which resulted from falsified inspection data. This could affect deliveries between the Tokyo-Kanto region and areas such as Hokkaido and Kyushu, with delays anticipated to exceed one day. 

Turning to the virtual world, ANYCOLOR, the operator of the VTuber group 'Nijisanji', has reported a decline in both revenue and profit for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2025, attributing this downturn to delays in merchandise delivery and the cancellation of events. 

In a more somber development, a company in Kawasaki has introduced a refrigerator designed for the post-mortem care of pets, allowing grieving owners to have more time with their deceased animals. This innovative product has also caught the attention of funeral service providers in China. 

Lastly, a new service called 'Kaze no Rei' has launched in the metaverse, offering a virtual cemetery where friends and family can gather to pay their respects to deceased loved ones. Future plans include the possibility of conversing with AI-recreated versions of the deceased, adding a unique dimension to the memorial experience.
