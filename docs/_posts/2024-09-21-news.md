Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on September 21st, 2024. In today's tech news, we start with an exciting new development in audio recording. A Japanese brand has introduced a smartphone-compatible binaural recording device called the W-BM1. This device allows users to capture realistic stereo sound effortlessly, making high-quality audio recording more accessible than ever before. With its affordable price point, it opens up new possibilities for content creators and audio enthusiasts looking to record immersive soundscapes on the go.

Switching gears, the popular household goods chain 3COINS has launched a new brand specifically tailored for men, called 3COINS MEN. This new line features a variety of products including wireless mice, keyboards, and business accessories. The move aims to cater to the growing demand for stylish yet functional items in the male demographic, expanding the brand's reach in the competitive market of men's goods.

In health-related news, Japan's Ministry of Health has unveiled a web tool called Alcohol Watch. This innovative platform allows users to input the amount of alcohol they have consumed and calculates the time it will take for their body to metabolize it. This tool is a step towards promoting responsible drinking and increasing awareness about alcohol consumption.

In a more serious turn of events, a tragic incident has occurred in Shenzhen, China, where a 10-year-old Japanese boy was fatally stabbed. The incident has stirred reactions on social media, with a mix of criticism and anti-Japanese sentiment emerging. Notably, major Chinese media outlets have remained silent on the matter, possibly due to information control by the authorities.

On a more positive note for the tech industry, PKSHA Technology, an AI venture based in Bunkyo, Tokyo, has made headlines by being upgraded to the Prime market of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. This transition marks a significant milestone for the company, reflecting its growth and the increasing interest in AI technologies.

Meanwhile, Nintendo's legal department, known for its formidable reputation, has been a hot topic on social media following a lawsuit related to the game Palworld. Many are curious about the actual work the legal team does and how they manage to maintain the company’s intellectual property rights.

Lastly, in gaming news, Capcom has teamed up with Nitori to release a range of gaming chairs inspired by its popular Monster Hunter franchise.
