In today's news, Amazon is kicking off its 'Prime Day Pre-Sale' at midnight on July 11th, ahead of the main Prime Day event starting on July 17th.

In other news, NTT Docomo announced the 20th anniversary of its contactless electronic payment service, 'Osaifu-Keitai', which uses the FeliCa chip. The service was launched on July 10th, 2004, and played a pioneering role in mobile payment services in Japan.

Moving on to partnerships, Docomo Bike Share and 'HELLO CYCLING', provided by SoftBank subsidiary OpenStreet, have announced a collaboration to allow users to park their bikes at each other's ports.
