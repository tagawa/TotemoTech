### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on July 28th, 2024. In today's news, we have two significant stories to discuss.

First, let's talk about the ongoing controversy surrounding the popular video game franchise, 'Assassin's Creed.' The 'Assassin's Creed' problem, which we previously covered, is still causing a stir. The situation has become increasingly confusing, with the controversy spreading to various platforms. To help clarify what's going on, a manga artist who is also a gaming enthusiast has attempted to organize the details.

Moving on to our second story, we have an exciting review of the 'Volvo EX30,' an electric vehicle (EV) that has caught the attention of Tesla owners. As part of our series focusing on EVs other than Tesla, we take a closer look at the Volvo EX30. This compact electric SUV, which Volvo has introduced as part of its commitment to complete electrification by 2030, has piqued the interest of a Tesla Model 3 user. Our reviewer will provide their perspective on the Volvo EX30 from the viewpoint of a Tesla owner.

In other news, Dwango, the company behind the popular video streaming site 'Nico Nico Douga,' has announced that the service will resume on August 5th after being temporarily suspended due to a cyber attack.

The Tokyo Metropolitan Park Association has issued a warning regarding the upcoming Sumida River Fireworks Festival. They emphasize that Shioiri Park is not a hidden gem and caution attendees to act responsibly, as they anticipate a larger crowd compared to previous years.

Security company HENNGE is organizing a unique security event at Kanda Shrine. They are inviting IT professionals to share their real-life scary stories, which will then be narrated by professional storytellers in a horror-themed setting.

In the world of snacks, Kameda Seika has released a card game called 'Kameda's Rice Cracker Concentration,' featuring 13 different rice cracker designs. Interestingly, the game does not include popular rice cracker flavors such as 'Kaki no Tane' and 'Happy Turn.' The decision behind this omission is quite intriguing.

Lastly, Japanese space venture ispace has unveiled a small lunar rover that will be launched this winter via a US rocket. The rover is set to land on the moon next year and collect lunar soil, with the intention of selling the ownership rights to NASA. If successful, this would mark the world's first commercial transaction on the moon.   Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
