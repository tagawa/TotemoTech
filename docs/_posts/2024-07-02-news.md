Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on July 2nd, 2024. In today's news, we have updates on the cyber attack against KADOKAWA and a revision to Instagram's AI labeling system.

First, KADOKAWA, the Japanese media company, has announced that the hacker group responsible for the cyber attack in June has leaked additional information. The company is currently investigating the credibility of these claims and expects to release the results of their investigation in July. KADOKAWA emphasizes the need for thorough verification before making any official statements.

Moving on to our next story, Meta, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, has made changes to its AI labeling system. Previously, images generated using AI were labeled as 'Made with AI.' However, after receiving feedback from users, Meta has revised the labeling to 'AI Info.' This change aims to address concerns raised by users who found that even images edited with filters were being labeled as AI-generated.

That's all for today's news. Stay tuned for more updates from TotemoTech.   Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
