Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on July 14th, 2024. In today's news, the anime 'Shikanokono Kono Koko Shitan-tan' is making waves this season. With the summer anime lineup in full swing, this dark horse has captured the attention of viewers with its unique storyline and catchy theme song. Moving on, Nikon has released the highly anticipated 'Z6III' camera, which boasts improved autofocus capabilities and a refined viewfinder. The third generation of the Z6 series, this camera is a significant upgrade from its predecessor, offering advanced features that are sure to impress photography enthusiasts. In other news, the renowned Japanese electric guitar manufacturer 'Fernandes' has filed for bankruptcy. Established in 1969, Fernandes has been known for its high-quality electric guitars, including artist models endorsed by famous musicians. This news comes as a shock to the music industry and fans of the brand. Shifting gears, the 'Digital Strategy EXPO 2024 Summer' event organized by ITmedia kicked off on July 9th. During the event, Mr. Kiyohi Nakata, a certified public accountant and the head researcher of the Japan CFO Association, delivered a speech on 'Financial Strategy.' His presentation emphasized the importance of effective financial management in driving business decisions. Turning our attention to technology, a portable cooler powered by batteries has been put to the test.

The new 'Compact Cooler' by Yamazen offers a convenient solution, allowing users to cool any room without the need for installation. Lastly, a 'deer' craze has taken over Japan, thanks to the popular TV anime 'Shikanokono Kono Koko Shitan-tan.' The show has sparked a nationwide fascination with deer, and even Google searches have seen an increase in queries related to these majestic animals. Wrapping up, Cainz, a home improvement retailer, has announced a voluntary recall of their 'Circulator' fans, which were released earlier this year. Several incidents of the fans catching fire during use have been reported, prompting the company to urge customers to immediately discontinue their usage. That's all for today's news.
