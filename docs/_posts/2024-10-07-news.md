Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on October 7th, 2024. In today's news, we start with the launch of a new game on Steam that has caught the attention of gaming enthusiasts. The game, titled '異変麻雀' or 'Anomaly Mahjong', challenges players to navigate unexpected events during gameplay, making it a uniquely difficult experience. Gamers are finding themselves immersed in this intriguing take on the classic Mahjong, as they strive to successfully complete their rounds despite the surprises that await them.

Switching gears, we turn to the scientific community where recent solar activity has made headlines. On October 1st and 3rd, two significant solar flares occurred, marking the 15th largest event of its kind in recorded history. While these flares released coronal gas towards Earth, experts believe the impact will be limited. However, there is a potential for disruptions in long-distance communications, particularly noted on October 5th, as the effects of these solar events play out.

In other news, Google Maps has sparked controversy by incorrectly labeling the Kawaguchi City Hall as 'Kurd City Hall'. This label has raised questions about the accuracy of online mapping services, especially as it relates to cultural and community representation. The situation highlights the challenges that can arise with digital mapping technologies and their implications for local identities.

Meanwhile, Osaka Gas is making strides in environmental technology with the development of a new AI system designed to evaluate the quality of carbon credits. This innovative approach aims to enhance the accuracy of measuring greenhouse gas reductions, boasting over 90% precision. The company plans to implement this system by 2025 and is considering offering it to other organizations and certification bodies as well.

In gaming news, the much-anticipated PS5 version of 'Palworld' has finally launched in Japan. The developers at Pocket Pair have apologized for the delay in its release, and fans are eager to dive into this new adventure.

Lastly, a health alert has emerged regarding the supplement derived from red koji. Recent research from Kanazawa University has revealed that a compound called 'Puberuru acid' exhibits toxicity levels comparable to certain chemotherapy drugs, raising concerns about its safety and implications for consumers. This finding underscores the importance of rigorous testing in the supplement industry.

In a related incident, the JF All Fisheries Federation has announced the closure of its online shopping site after a significant data breach. Reports indicate that around 12,000 card details may have been compromised due to a vulnerability in their payment application. This incident serves as a reminder of the ongoing challenges in cybersecurity for online platforms.   Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
