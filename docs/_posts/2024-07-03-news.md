### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on July 3rd, 2024. In today's news, Chinese tech company Xiaomi has released a new product: pens. These are not your ordinary pens, as they don't have any electrical components or Bluetooth connectivity. They come in two types, ballpoint and gel pens, and are available for purchase at Xiaomi's official store, as well as at pop-up stores in Rakuten Ichiba and Shibuya PARCO.

Moving on to our next story, a serious vulnerability has been discovered in the SSH software OpenSSH. The vulnerability, named 'regreSSHion' (CVE-2024-6387), allows remote execution of arbitrary code without authentication, giving the attacker root privileges. This vulnerability affects over 14 million servers worldwide, posing a significant security risk.

Next up, Japanese video sharing platform Nico Nico Douga has announced that it will take legal action against the malicious spread of leaked information related to cyber attacks on the company and its partner KADOKAWA. The company plans to work with lawyers to combat the dissemination of this sensitive information on social media platforms.

In other news, it has been one year since the introduction of 'specific motorized bicycles' in Japan. During this time, a total of 21,562 cases have been reported for violations such as running red lights and driving in restricted areas.

Moving on, the Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications has announced that it will ban the allocation of points for donations made through intermediary websites starting from October 2025. The Minister, Tsuyoshi Matsumoto, explained that the aim is to ensure that additional benefits obtained by donors are properly regulated.

Shifting our focus to China, it has been one year since the implementation of the revised Anti-Spy Law, which strengthens spy prevention measures in the country. Concerns have been raised internationally regarding the increased authority given to Chinese officials to inspect personal smartphones and computers at the border. Critics argue that the explanations provided by Chinese authorities have been insufficient.

And finally, OM Digital Solutions has unveiled a new camera designed specifically for astrophotography. The 'OM SYSTEM E-M1 Mark III ASTRO' is a mirrorless camera with optical characteristics optimized for capturing celestial objects. It will be sold as a set with two types of filters, allowing photographers to capture vivid images of red nebulae and other astronomical phenomena.
