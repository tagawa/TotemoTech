### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on August 8th, 2024. In today's news, we have two significant stories to discuss.

First, let's talk about the alarming increase in domain hijacking attacks. Attackers are exploiting vulnerabilities in DNS management to take control of famous company domains and use them for scams and spam emails. These attacks can be executed easily and often go unnoticed, leaving over a million domains vulnerable to misuse. It's crucial for companies to strengthen their DNS security measures to avoid becoming easy targets.

Moving on to our next story, Oracle has surpassed IBM in global cloud infrastructure market share. According to a report by Synergy Research Group, Oracle has taken the lead in the second quarter of 2024. This development highlights the growing competition in the cloud infrastructure market and Oracle's success in attracting customers.

In other news, NTT's President, Akira Shimada, announced the company's intention to discontinue its telegram service. Over the past 60 years, telegram usage has declined by 96%, mainly due to the rise of the internet. The company has already terminated related services, and the future of telegram was under consideration. While there is still some demand for telegrams during celebrations and condolences, the overall usage decline has led to this decision.

Next, let's explore the mystery of an unusual vending machine in Toyama. This vending machine appears to be a regular red vending machine, but upon closer inspection, it features the logo of Buffalo, a well-known networking solutions company. Surprisingly, the machine only sells wireless LAN routers manufactured by Buffalo. It's unclear why such a vending machine exists and whether Buffalo is involved in this unique marketing approach.

Moving on, a recent survey by Adobe reveals that Japanese marketers are more cautious in adopting AI-generated content compared to their counterparts in other countries. While more than half of Japanese marketers acknowledge the potential of AI-generated content, the utilization rate in Japan is the lowest among seven countries surveyed, including the UK and France. This finding sheds light on the conservative approach of Japanese marketers towards AI-generated content.

In a unique initiative, Chunichi Shimbun, a Japanese newspaper, has showcased 3D models of war relics on the VR platform VRChat. This exhibition aims to document the current state of these war relics, which are gradually deteriorating over time. By preserving them in virtual reality, the newspaper hopes to raise awareness about the importance of preserving historical sites.

Lastly, the Rakuten Group has rebranded its online grocery service from 'Rakuten Seiyu Net Super' to 'Rakuten Mart.' This name change reflects the company's efforts to align its online supermarket with its overall brand identity. Customers can expect the same convenient online grocery shopping experience under the new name.
