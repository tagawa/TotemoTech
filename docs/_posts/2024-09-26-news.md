Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on September 26th, 2024. In exciting astronomical news, researchers from Madrid's Complutense University have announced that Earth will temporarily capture a small celestial body, resulting in a phenomenon known as a mini-moon, which will be visible from September 29th to November 25th this year. This event marks a unique opportunity for skywatchers and scientists alike to observe this transient addition to our planet's orbit.

Shifting gears to technology, Meta has made a significant splash at its Meta Connect 2024 conference, unveiling its latest innovation in augmented reality with the introduction of the Orion AR glasses. These glasses are touted as true standalone AR devices, drawing inspiration from the animated series 'Denno Coil.' Notably, they can be operated using muscle signals, showcasing a leap forward in user interaction.

In addition to the Orion glasses, Meta also introduced the Meta Quest 3S, a new entry-level mixed reality headset priced from 48,400 yen. This model retains the performance of the Meta Quest 3 while adopting the panel and optical system from the previous version, aiming to provide an accessible option for those interested in mixed reality experiences.

In automotive news, Tesla continues to highlight its competitive edge with over-the-air software updates. The recent summer update has introduced several new features that enhance user experience, reinforcing Tesla's reputation for innovation and customer satisfaction.

Meanwhile, in a survey conducted by Findy, a job placement service for engineers, IT professionals were asked to choose between two contrasting work conditions: a full in-office role with an annual salary of 20 million yen or a fully remote position with a salary of 8 million yen. The results of this survey reflect the ongoing debate about work preferences in the tech industry.

On the mobile front, Apple has rolled out iOS 18, featuring a new function called 'Vehicle Motion Cue' designed to alleviate motion sickness for users. A reporter prone to motion sickness tested this feature and reported on its effectiveness, adding to the ongoing improvements in user comfort with mobile devices.

Lastly, in a unique initiative, En-Japan has begun accepting applications for mayoral candidates in Shijonawate City, Osaka. This marks the first time a private recruitment service has been involved in the public selection of local government leaders, potentially paving the way for more innovative approaches to civic engagement.
