### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on May 30th, 2024. In today's news, we have two significant stories to discuss.

First, the popular manga publisher Shueisha has launched a new manga app called Jump TOON. This app focuses on vertical reading, also known as 'tate-yomi,' and offers a unique reading experience. The app debuted with 28 titles, including popular series like 'Haikyu!!' in vertical color format and original works. Shueisha plans to update the app with at least four new titles every day and introduce new series regularly.

Moving on to our second story, there has been a privacy breach at Sendai Municipal Hospital in Japan. A staff member posted a photo of a patient's medical record on Instagram, making it accessible to the public for nearly a month. The hospital has acknowledged the incident and is taking measures to prevent such incidents from happening again, including reinforcing awareness among all staff members.

In other news, Niantic, the company behind the popular augmented reality game 'Pokemon Go,' has released the Android version of their 3D scanning app called Scaniverse. This app allows users to create 3D scans of real-world objects using their smartphones. It requires Android 7.0 or higher, at least 4GB of memory, and support for ARCore and Depth API.

Next, we have a warning from the National Consumer Affairs Center of Japan regarding an increase in impersonation scams on social media. Scammers are pretending to be celebrities or their associates and luring consumers into investment or financial product purchases. The number of reported cases has increased approximately tenfold in the past year, and the average amount of money involved has also risen. The center advises caution when encountering such solicitations on social media platforms.

In a surprising move, NHK, Japan's public broadcaster, has announced the closure of their 'note' page where they have been sharing their 'Investigation Notes' since 2020. The page will be shut down at the end of June. Despite the high praise from readers, NHK has decided to discontinue this platform.

In transportation news, eight railway companies, including JR East, Keisei, Seibu, and Tobu, have announced the discontinuation of magnetic ticketing and the introduction of QR code-based ticketing. This change aims to improve convenience and streamline ticketing systems across multiple railway networks.

Lastly, three major parking lot operators, Park24, Times24, and Toko Kogyo, will conduct a trial of 15kW chargers for electric vehicles in their time-based parking lots starting from July 8th. This trial is part of the 'aima CHARGE' EV charging service and aims to provide a convenient charging option for EV owners.
