Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on August 10th, 2024. In today's news, let's start with the scorching summer heat and the need for air conditioners. With temperatures exceeding 35 degrees Celsius, air conditioners have become indispensable. However, if your air conditioner breaks down, it can take a long time for repairs or even more than 10 days for a replacement to be installed. To address this issue, we want to introduce a possible solution: window air conditioners that you can install yourself.

Moving on to our next story, the popular doujin shop, Toh-no-ana, has made an unexpected announcement regarding its online sales. Starting from the 13th of August, Visa and Mastercard payments will no longer be accepted. This decision comes just before the upcoming Comiket event.

Now, let's talk about a new development in digital payment services. The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has designated PayPay, a code payment service, as a designated fund transfer agent for receiving salaries. PayPay will offer a service that allows employees to receive their salaries through the PayPay platform by the end of this year. This means that employers will be able to pay their employees' salaries using PayPay balance (PayPay Money) if requested.

Shifting gears, let's discuss the end of an era in cloud gaming. The cloud gaming service, G Cluster, which was the first of its kind in Japan, will come to an end on February 28th, 2025. This service has a history of 10 years, with its technology spanning 20 years.

Moving on to international cooperation in combating cybercrime, the United Nations General Assembly's Special Committee has adopted a draft treaty on cybercrime investigations. This treaty aims to establish guidelines for international cooperation in cases of crimes such as unauthorized access and the dissemination of child pornography. The draft will soon be formally adopted during the General Assembly's plenary session.

Next, let's reflect on the end of the camping boom that was sparked during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in 2024, we have observed a decline in the camping trend. Let's take a moment to look back and see what the camping boom has left behind.

Lastly, JR East has announced its plans to resume the sale of named Suica cards in the autumn of 2024. The sale of Suica cards has been temporarily suspended for a long time, but JR East has been preparing to resume the sale of named cards. According to the company, this decision was made due to the availability of a certain quantity of inventory.
