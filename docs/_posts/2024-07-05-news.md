Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on July 5th, 2024. In today's news, Dutch researchers from the University of Utrecht have conducted experiments and simulations to demonstrate the most efficient way to pack multiple small spheres into a bag. Their findings could have implications for various industries that involve packing objects. Moving on to our next story, Google has issued a warning regarding issues with its 'Pixel 6' series of smartphones. Users have reported problems that can be resolved by performing a factory reset, but Google is working on providing a solution to avoid the need for a reset. Now, let's turn our attention to another story. FamilyMart, a popular convenience store chain in Japan, has responded to allegations of copyright infringement related to an image posted on their official 'X' account. The company has stated that the image does not infringe any copyrights. Shifting gears, we have news from Toyota City. The city has announced that personal information of approximately 420,000 individuals may have been leaked due to a ransomware attack on a printing contractor, Iseto. The contractor was responsible for printing tax notifications and other documents. This incident highlights the ongoing challenges posed by cyber threats. Next up, we have an interesting development in the retail industry. The well-established department store, Daimaru Matsuzakaya, is now selling 'high-end avatars.' These avatars have been designed with the help of the image director of a popular artist, Ado. The department store aims to cater to customers looking for unique and luxurious digital experiences. Moving on, we have a new audio technology innovation from Kumamoto Prefecture. A 'tatami speaker' has been developed, allowing users to experience body sonic effects while lying down on a tatami mat. The speaker can be connected via Bluetooth for a seamless audio experience. Lastly, we have news regarding a security breach on a security support website operated by the Kyoto Prefectural Police. The website, designed to assist small and medium-sized enterprises with information security, was found to have been tampered with, redirecting users to another site. The Kyoto Prefectural Police has acknowledged the incident as a serious mistake and is investigating the matter. That's it for today's news. Thank you for tuning in to TotemoTech.
