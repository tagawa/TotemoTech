Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on June 3rd, 2024. In today's news, we have some interesting stories from the world of technology in Japan.

First up, the PlayStation 5 game 'Stellar Blade' is making waves in the gaming industry. This game has been topping the Famitsu sales rankings for three consecutive weeks, securing the number one spot. It has become a hit among gamers, but what is the secret behind its success? Well, according to a manga artist who claims to have no interest in 'sexy games,' the game's appeal lies in its captivating storyline and innovative gameplay.

Moving on, let's talk about the Lumix S9 camera. Recently, there has been a controversy surrounding the stock photos used to showcase the camera's features and performance. It turns out that the photos used were not professionally taken but rather purchased images. This revelation has caused quite a stir among photography enthusiasts and raises questions about the authenticity of the camera's capabilities.

Next, we have a concerning data breach. Workstyle Tech, a subsidiary of Kaonavi, has announced a leak of user information affecting approximately 150,000 individuals. The leaked data includes personal details such as My Number images and even credit card information. This incident has prompted a thorough investigation, leading to a revision in the initial number of affected users. The extent of the damage and the potential consequences for the affected individuals are still being assessed.

In the world of cryptocurrencies, DMM Bitcoin, a subsidiary of the DMM Group, has disclosed a significant loss. Approximately 48.2 billion yen worth of Bitcoin (4502.9 BTC) has been reported as stolen. To address this issue, the company plans to secure the necessary funds through support from its group companies and fully guarantee the amount lost by its customers.

Moving away from gaming and cybersecurity, let's discuss an issue that could catch unsuspecting internet users off guard. The National Consumer Affairs Center of Japan has issued a warning regarding advertisements that mimic website buttons, such as the 'Start' button. These ads have led to unintended subscription agreements when users unknowingly click on them and provide their personal information. It is crucial for internet users to exercise caution and pay attention to the details before engaging with such advertisements.

Shifting gears, we turn our attention to the virtual world. The Cabinet Office's initiative, 'Platobus,' which aimed to combat loneliness and isolation, has announced an early closure of its metaverse platform. This decision comes after receiving feedback from social media users who expressed concerns about the restriction on conversations within the metaverse. While the initiative had good intentions, it seems that the limitations imposed on users hindered the platform's effectiveness.

Lastly, we have news from the world of mobile gaming. Aniplex has announced the upcoming discontinuation of the smartphone app 'Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story' for iOS and Android. After more than six years of service, this spin-off game based on the popular anime 'Puella Magi Madoka Magica' will be bidding farewell to its dedicated player base.
