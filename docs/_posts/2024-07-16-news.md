Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on July 16th, 2024. In today's news, we have two interesting stories to share. First, we'll talk about the challenges faced by a HR startup called Hackazook, which provides services to companies like Toyota. During the pandemic, Hackazook experienced a period of zero orders, which CEO will tell us about. It was a tough time for the company, but they managed to bounce back.

Next, let's turn our attention to the world of anime. One particular anime series called 'Shikanokono Kono Koko Shitan Tan' has been making waves this summer. Many people can't get the catchy theme song out of their heads. However, some fans were surprised when they watched the actual anime episodes. It seems that the show has taken a darker turn than expected.

Moving on to other news, Nikon has released its latest camera model, the Z6III. This third-generation camera offers improved autofocus and a new finder. It's a significant upgrade from the previous model and is worth checking out if you're a photography enthusiast.

In unfortunate news, the renowned Japanese electric guitar manufacturer, Fernandes, has filed for bankruptcy. Established in 1969, Fernandes was known for its high-quality guitars and had collaborations with many famous artists. It's a sad day for the music industry, as another iconic brand faces financial difficulties.

On the business front, the importance of finance strategy was highlighted at the recent 'Digital Strategy Expo 2024 Summer' event. During the 'Financial Strategy' category, Mr. Kiyoho Nakata, a certified public accountant and the head researcher of the Japan CFO Association, discussed the role of finance in promoting rational business decisions.

In the midst of the summer heat, portable coolers have become essential. One new addition to the market is the battery-powered 'Compact Cooler' by Yamazen. We tested this cooler in a room with a temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, and it proved to be effective in providing relief from the heat.

Lastly, a surprising trend has emerged involving deer, or 'shika' in Japanese. The popular anime series 'Shikanokono Kono Koko Shitan Tan' has sparked a deer boom in Japan. Even Google searches are showing an increase in deer-related queries. It seems like these cute animals have captured the hearts and attention of many.
