### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on September 22nd, 2024. In recent news, the gaming community was taken aback when Sony Interactive Entertainment decided to shut down the service for its new game 'CONCORD' just two weeks after its release. This swift decision has sparked discussions about the impact of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, or DEI, initiatives on the gaming industry, raising questions among fans about the future of game development in this evolving landscape.

On a different note, Sony has also announced two new camcorders, the 'PXW-Z200' and 'HXR-NX800', which have been highly anticipated by industry professionals. These models are seen as a significant upgrade for television production, especially for variety and documentary shoots. The previous models, the 'PXW-Z150' and 'PXW-Z190', have been discontinued, making the arrival of these new camcorders a welcome change in the market.

In tech innovation, a Japanese brand has introduced a new product called 'W-BM1' that allows users to easily record binaural audio using their smartphones. This device captures realistic stereo sound, making it accessible for anyone looking to create immersive audio experiences without breaking the bank.

Meanwhile, the popular Japanese retail chain '3COINS' has launched a new brand targeting men, named '3COINS MEN'. This new line includes a variety of products such as wireless mice, keyboards, and other business accessories, expanding their market reach to male consumers.

In health-related news, the Japanese Ministry of Health has unveiled a new web tool called 'Alcohol Watch'. This tool allows individuals to input the amount of alcohol consumed and calculates the time it would take for their body to metabolize it, promoting responsible drinking habits among the public.

Lastly, in a more somber story, a tragic incident occurred in Shenzhen, China, where a ten-year-old Japanese boy was fatally stabbed. The Chinese media has been notably silent on the matter, indicating potential information control by authorities, which has led to mixed reactions on social media, ranging from criticism to anti-Japanese sentiments.

In business news, PKSHA Technology, an AI venture based in Bunkyo, Tokyo, has received a significant boost as the Tokyo Stock Exchange has upgraded its listing from the Standard market to the Prime market, reflecting its growth and prominence in the tech industry.
