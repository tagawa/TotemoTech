### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on October 5th, 2024. In a surprising turn of events, Google Maps has mistakenly labeled the Kawaguchi City Hall in Saitama Prefecture as 'Kurd City Hall.' This incident has drawn attention to the complexities surrounding immigration and cultural representation in Japan. Users searching for the city hall were met with this unexpected designation, prompting discussions on how digital platforms can sometimes misrepresent locations and communities.

In other news, Osaka Gas has announced the development of a new system that utilizes generative artificial intelligence to assess the quality of carbon credits. This innovative approach aims to enhance the accuracy of carbon credit evaluations, achieving over 90 percent precision. The company plans to implement this system by 2025 for its own carbon credit procurement and is considering offering it to other companies and certification organizations.

On the gaming front, the PS5 version of 'Palworld' has officially launched in Japan. The game maker Pocket Pair expressed their apologies for the delayed release, which has been highly anticipated by fans.

In health news, a recent study from Kanazawa University has revealed that a substance called 'Pubeluric Acid,' associated with a red yeast supplement scandal, has kidney toxicity comparable to that of certain chemotherapy drugs. This finding marks the first confirmation of its nephrotoxic effects through human cell experiments.

Meanwhile, the JF All Fisheries Federation has closed its online store after a significant data breach, potentially exposing 12,000 card information records. The breach was linked to an XSS vulnerability that allowed unauthorized access to their payment application.

In corporate news, a former employee of TDK has been referred to prosecutors for allegedly stealing research data from the company's computers. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department's Public Security Bureau has filed charges against the 65-year-old man for violating the Unfair Competition Prevention Act, although he has not publicly commented on the allegations.

Lastly, after a six-month hiatus, orders for the mirrorless camera 'OM-D E-M10 Mark IV' have resumed. This model, which was initially released in September 2020, is now back in stock and available for enthusiasts.
