### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on September 24th, 2024. In a surprising turn of events, Sony Interactive Entertainment has decided to shut down the service for its game 'Concord' just two weeks after its release. This has left many gaming enthusiasts in shock, with some suggesting that the ongoing discussions around diversity, equity, and inclusion may have influenced this decision. The rapid closure raises questions about the game's reception and the broader implications of DEI in the gaming industry.

On a different note, Sony has recently unveiled two new camcorders, the PXW-Z200 and HXR-NX800, which have been highly anticipated by professionals in the television industry. Both models are seen as much-needed replacements for the now discontinued XDCAM series cameras that have been staples for variety shows and documentaries. The introduction of these camcorders represents a significant shift in the tools available for media production, catering to the evolving needs of content creators.

In the realm of audio technology, a new product from the Japanese brand Wismar allows users to easily record binaural sound using their smartphones. This innovation aims to make high-quality stereo recording more accessible and affordable, opening up new possibilities for capturing immersive audio experiences.

Meanwhile, the popular Japanese merchandise chain 3COINS has launched a new brand targeted at men, called '3COINS MEN.' This line features a variety of products including wireless mice, keyboards, and other business accessories, expanding the brand's offerings to better cater to male consumers.

In health news, Japan's Ministry of Health has introduced a web tool called 'Alcohol Watch.' This online resource enables users to input the amount of alcohol consumed and calculates the time required for the body to metabolize it, promoting awareness about alcohol consumption and its effects.

On a more serious note, a tragic incident in Shenzhen, China, has drawn attention after a 10-year-old Japanese boy was fatally stabbed. The response on social media has been mixed, with criticism and anti-Japanese sentiments surfacing, while major Chinese media outlets have remained silent, suggesting a possible information control by the authorities.

Lastly, in financial news, PKSHA Technology, an AI venture based in Tokyo, has made headlines by being upgraded to the Prime market on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. This change reflects the company's growth and the increasing significance of AI technologies in the market.   Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
