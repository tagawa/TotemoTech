### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on June 15th, 2024. In today's news, FujiFilm has released a highly recommended camera for those who prefer still photography over videos. The X-T50 is a compact and lightweight camera that caters to the needs of photographers who prioritize capturing still images. Moving on to our next story, DMM Bitcoin, which suffered a leak of approximately 4502.9 BTC worth around 48.2 billion yen at the end of May, has announced the completion of compensation for the leaked funds. The company managed to secure 55 billion yen from its group companies to cover the losses. Now shifting gears, let's talk about the recent G7 Summit. One of the topics discussed was the ethical use of AI, particularly in relation to its negative aspects such as military applications and the spread of misinformation. The G7 leaders emphasized the need for international cooperation to address these concerns and ensure responsible AI development. Next up, let's delve into the cyberattack that targeted NicoNico. Dwango, the parent company, has provided an overview of the incident, revealing that it was a large-scale cyberattack involving ransomware. The recovery process is expected to take more than a month. And now for something a bit lighter, Shogakukan is releasing a commemorative magazine called 'Famicom 40th Anniversary' on July 1st. The magazine will include a 1/1 scale papercraft of the iconic Famicom console. Lastly, we have an update on the cyberattack on KADOKAWA. The company aims to restore its core systems by the end of June, although there is a possibility of payment delays for some business partners. That's all for today's news.
