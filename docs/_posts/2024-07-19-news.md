Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on July 19th, 2024. In today's news, researchers in South Korea have announced a new study on improving the flavor of lab-grown meat. Scientists from Yonsei University and Kangwon National University have developed a pink jelly that enhances the taste of cultured meat. Moving on to our next story, researchers from Trento University and Padua University in Italy have made an exciting discovery on the moon. They have found a tunnel leading to accessible underground caves beneath the holes in the lunar seas. This discovery opens up possibilities for future moon base exploration. Now, let's shift gears to the world of anime. Yanmar Holdings, a well-known manufacturer of agricultural machinery, has announced that their upcoming original anime, 'Miru Watashi no Mirai,' will be broadcast on terrestrial TV in spring 2025. The anime will feature the 9th generation of the popular character 'Yanbo Maabo.' Next up, Internet Initiative Japan (IIJ) subsidiary NetChart has announced the general sale of their 'eco-patch' Cat.6 LAN cable. This LAN cable, which is used in IIJ's own data centers, will be available for purchase starting from July 26th through the IIJmio Supplier Service. Shifting to the world of virtual YouTubers, VTuber Mikeneko has announced that they have reached a satisfactory resolution in their contract negotiations with Cover, the management company behind Hololive Production. Finally, NTT has made a groundbreaking discovery in the field of e-sports. They have found that pre-match brainwaves contain patterns strongly related to the outcome of e-sports matches.
