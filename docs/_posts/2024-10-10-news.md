Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on October 10th, 2024. In today's news, Nintendo has made a surprising entry into the alarm clock market with the launch of the Nintendo Sound Clock, also known as Alarmo. This innovative device reacts to user movements by playing sounds from popular games like Splatoon, and it is priced at 12,980 yen. Moving on to the automotive industry, Honda has unveiled groundbreaking production technologies for its next-generation electric vehicles. These include a world-first welding technique that allows for the use of lighter and stronger steel plates, as well as a large aluminum casting system that significantly reduces the number of parts needed. This advancement positions Honda to compete more effectively with companies like Tesla. In other news, the Information and Communications Research Institute has issued a warning regarding a large solar flare that could lead to communication disruptions over the next few days. They advise caution for those using space systems during this period. Meanwhile, in the financial sector, there has been significant controversy surrounding the Aeon Card, issued by Aeon Financial Services. Users have expressed frustration over delayed responses to fraudulent activity that was first reported in June. Despite requests to halt unauthorized charges, many users continued to incur losses, leading to widespread complaints on social media. In a different realm, a former employee of Toyota's advertising subsidiary has been arrested for orchestrating a fraudulent scheme involving fake orders that allegedly defrauded Daihatsu of approximately 160 million yen. Lastly, in a cultural update, the iconic Kuidaore Taro will be transformed into a six-meter tall three-dimensional sign as part of the renovation of the Nakaza Kuidaore Building in Osaka, set to reopen in the spring of 2025.
