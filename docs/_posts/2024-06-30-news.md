Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on June 30th, 2024. In today's news, two anime films have been making waves in Japan. The first one is 'Look Back,' a movie adaptation of a popular short manga that was published on 'Jump+' in 2021. The film has received praise from both manga fans and non-manga readers alike. It has been highly anticipated since its announcement and has finally been released. The second anime is 'Shikanoko no Konoko Shita,' which is set to premiere next month. Before its broadcast, the official opening video of the anime has already garnered over 5.4 million views in just one month. People are talking about its catchy intro that can get stuck in your head. 

Moving on to the gaming world, the annual Steam Summer Sale has started. PC gamers can enjoy discounts on various games, including popular titles like 'Elden Ring' and 'Palworld.' The sale will last until 2 a.m. on July 12th. So, if you've been waiting to grab some games at a lower price, now is the time.

Next up, SoftBank, WaiMoBaiL, and LINEMO users have a reason to rejoice. They can now access the AI-powered search engine called 'Perplexity' for free for a year. This search engine's premium version is usually paid, but the telecom company is offering it as a complimentary service to its users. We'll discuss the features and potential uses of 'Perplexity' later in the episode.

In other news, Luma Labs, an AI startup, has introduced a new feature to its video generation AI called 'Luma Dream Machine.' This feature allows users to specify the ending frame of a video, enabling the creation of 'in-between videos' that seamlessly transition from one point to another. It's an exciting development for content creators and video enthusiasts.

Moving on, design software company Figma has announced the launch of 'Figma Slides,' a presentation slide creation tool. This tool combines Figma's design capabilities with interactive presentation features. The beta version of Figma Slides is currently available for free, and the company plans to introduce paid plans in early 2025.

Lastly, Elecom has released a series of 'solo-person appliances.' These appliances are designed for individuals who prefer to cook for themselves. The inspiration behind their development came from the strong desire to enjoy delicious food that can be quickly prepared without much hassle. The popularity of cooking appliances has grown during the pandemic, and although the demand has slightly declined post-pandemic, many new cooking appliances are still being introduced to the market.
