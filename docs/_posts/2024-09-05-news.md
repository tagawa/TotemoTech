Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on September 5th, 2024. In today's tech news, researchers from Beijing University, Harvard, and MIT have published findings from an experiment conducted in 2019, where they provided 1,800 Chinese students with free access to an uncensored internet via VPN. This study aimed to investigate the effects of unrestricted internet access on students in a heavily monitored environment. The results have sparked discussions on the implications of internet freedom in China.

In product news, GoPro has announced two new models, the GoPro HERO and the HERO13 Black. The HERO is being touted as the smallest 4K camera in the GoPro lineup, while the HERO13 Black brings back GPS functionality that was absent in the previous version. Both models feature several new capabilities, reflecting GoPro's commitment to innovation in the action camera space.

Meanwhile, in a surprising turn of events, Sony Interactive Entertainment has decided to discontinue its new game "CONCORD" just two weeks after its launch on PS5 and PC. The game, which had been in development for eight years, will see its service halted on September 6th, raising questions about the game's performance and reception in the market.

In a significant investment move, Hitachi has announced a plan to invest 300 billion yen into generative AI technologies. This initiative aims to address labor shortages and other societal challenges by enhancing support services for businesses.

The company is also forming partnerships with major IT firms to bolster its service offerings and capitalize on growth opportunities.

Lastly, Nissin's latest web commercial featuring a collaboration with the game "El Shaddai" has garnered significant attention, achieving over 10 million impressions on social media within just a day of its release. This promotion taps into nostalgia for internet memes from the early 2010s, prompting discussions about how the generation that grew up with platforms like Nico Nico Douga is now influencing marketing strategies.
