Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on August 22nd, 2024. In today's news, we have some interesting updates from the world of technology.

First up, let's talk about the latest trends in online shopping. According to the Yahoo! Shopping Trend Ranking for the first half of 2024, virtual reality (VR) took the top spot, while electric kick scooters came in second. It seems that more and more people are embracing the immersive experience of VR and the convenience of electric kick scooters.

Moving on, JR West, one of Japan's major railway companies, has announced the launch of a new mobile payment service called Wesmo! The service, set to be introduced in spring 2025, will support both touch and QR code payments. In addition, Wesmo! will also allow members to transfer money to each other. This new payment option aims to provide a seamless and convenient experience for JR West customers.

Next, let's talk about a new service that aims to speed up the delivery of return gifts for hometown tax donations. The service, called 'Asuchaku Furusato Nōzei,' promises to deliver the gifts as quickly as the next day. This will surely be a welcome improvement for those who make hometown tax donations and look forward to receiving their rewards promptly.

Now, let's shift our focus to the world of cybersecurity. A podcast called 'Security no Are' has been gaining attention among young security professionals. In collaboration with Shigehiro Tsuji, a member of the podcast and recipient of the Minister of Internal Affairs and Communications Award in 2021, the show explores the future of the security industry. In the latest episode, they interview Shinji Abe, who recently launched the SOC (Security Operation Center) business at GMO Cybersecurity by Ierae. The conversation revolves around the importance of cybersecurity and the need to protect not only large corporations but also small and medium-sized enterprises.

Lastly, we have a report about a security breach on the crowdfunding site Makuake. For a period of 48 minutes on August 19th, a glitch occurred that allowed users' accounts to be swapped with others. This resulted in at least one person's information being viewed by another user. The incident highlights the importance of robust security measures to protect personal and financial data.
