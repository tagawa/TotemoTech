Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on September 17th, 2024. Researchers at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev have proposed a new attack method that involves eavesdropping on the noise emitted from the screens of air-gapped PCs, which are computers that are not connected to the internet. This method could potentially allow attackers to steal sensitive data without direct access to the machine. The implications of this research raise significant concerns about data security, especially for organizations that rely on air-gapped systems to protect their information.

In other news, Apple’s AirTag has been making headlines for its role in aiding crime investigations. A woman in California, who had been repeatedly victimized by mail theft, used an AirTag to track down a suspect. This incident has sparked discussions about the effectiveness of AirTags in crime prevention and investigation. While the device is primarily marketed as a tool for locating lost items, its application in real-world crime scenarios is proving to be quite beneficial.

On the gaming front, the recently released Nintendo Switch game "Doraemon: The Dorayaki Shop Story" has garnered positive reviews. Developed by Kairosoft, this game is being praised for its homage to the works of Fujiko F. Fujio. Players are finding themselves engrossed in the gameplay, highlighting the nostalgic appeal and creativity that the game brings to the table.

In technology news, Apple has announced that pre-orders for the iPhone 16 series will begin today at 9 PM. The pricing details have been released by various carriers, including KDDI, SoftBank, and Rakuten Mobile, with consumers eager to find out which model will be the most affordable.

Meanwhile, BenQ Japan has announced a free replacement program for certain AC adapters used in their LCD displays. This decision comes after reports of smoking incidents related to the adapters, which raised safety concerns among users.

Lastly, Unity Technologies has retracted its controversial 'Runtime Fee' policy that had drawn significant backlash from game developers worldwide. The fee was intended to charge developers based on the number of installations for their games, but the outcry was strong enough to prompt Unity to reconsider.
