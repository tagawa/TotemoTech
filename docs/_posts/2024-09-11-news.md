Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on September 11th, 2024. In today's tech news, Sony Interactive Entertainment has officially announced the PlayStation 5 Pro, set to launch this November with a price of approximately 120,000 yen. This upgraded console promises enhanced performance and graphics, catering to the growing demand for high-quality gaming experiences.

In a groundbreaking move, Huawei has introduced the world's first triple-fold smartphone, the HUAWEI Mate XT. Unveiled on September 10th in China, this innovative device folds down to a size comparable to a standard smartphone but expands to reveal a stunning 10.2-inch display. With a starting price of around 400,000 yen, it marks a significant advancement in smartphone technology.

Switching gears to quantum technology, researchers from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology have proposed a new method of quantum communication using quantum holograms. This technique allows for the transmission of messages that can be erased, offering intriguing possibilities for secure communications in the future.

In another fascinating development, scientists from Stanford University have reported a breakthrough in non-invasive observation of internal organs. They have developed a yellow liquid that, when applied to the skin, temporarily renders it transparent. This technique successfully allowed for the visualization of internal structures in live mice, opening doors to new medical imaging methods.

On the gaming front, Pokémon GO has introduced a new feature called Max Battle, which allows players to engage in battles with Dynamax Pokémon. Players are already testing this new feature, with reports of solo victories against challenging opponents.

Lastly, Tesla Japan has announced a recall affecting four of its electric vehicle models due to an issue with cameras that may fail to detect obstacles if dirty. The company plans to address this concern through a software update, ensuring drivers receive proper warnings.
