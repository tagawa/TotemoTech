### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on July 10th, 2024. In today's news, we have two significant stories to discuss.

First, in the United States, there was a system failure in the emergency call system 911 in Massachusetts. Due to this failure, people were unable to connect their emergency calls temporarily. However, amidst the chaos, an old technology came to the rescue. The spotlight was on the traditional red telephone boxes, which were used as an alternative means to contact the police and fire departments.

Moving on to our second story, there has been a significant development in the opposition to the ban on point rewards for furusato tax in Japan. The Rakuten Group announced that the number of signatures opposing the ban has surpassed 1 million. The signatures were collected starting from June 28th, and Rakuten's CEO, Hiroshi Mikitani, also called for signatures on X (formerly known as Twitter).

Next, a US security company, Phylum, has issued a warning about a specific version of the JavaScript library 'jQuery' being infected with a Trojan horse. This infected version has been spreading through platforms like GitHub. Users are advised to be cautious and update their libraries to prevent any potential security breaches.

In other news, the first oral argument took place in the lawsuit filed by Yusaku Maezawa, the founder of the clothing retailer ZOZO, against Meta and other tech giants. Maezawa claims that he was a victim of impersonation fraud through misleading advertisements on social media. He is seeking compensation for damages and a ban on the publication of such advertisements. Meta, on the other hand, is pushing for the dismissal of the claims and has shown a willingness to fight the lawsuit.

Shifting our focus to the Tokyo gubernatorial election, it has been revealed that Shinjiro Ishimaru achieved an overwhelming victory in terms of the total number of views for YouTube-related videos. Ishimaru's videos surpassed 100 million views, solidifying the significant role that YouTube played in his successful campaign, which resulted in him finishing second in terms of votes.

In funding news, the ride-sharing startup newmo, based in Tokyo's Minato Ward, announced that it has raised over 10 billion yen in funding. The details of the funding sources will be disclosed at a later date, but this brings the total amount raised by newmo to over 12 billion yen.

Finally, Pixiv has issued a warning to the shop owners on its art sales platform, BOOTH, regarding a series of extortion messages demanding money. Shop owners have been advised to report such incidents to the police and remain vigilant.   Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
