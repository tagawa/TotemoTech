Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on August 1st, 2024. In today's news, researchers from the University of Victoria in Canada have conducted a detailed analysis on the relationship between alcohol consumption and mortality risk. Their study, which analyzed 107 research papers, reveals the findings of the correlation between alcohol consumption and overall mortality rate. The researchers found that moderate alcohol consumption may have some health benefits, contradicting the popular saying 'sake is the best medicine.' However, they also caution that excessive alcohol consumption can have detrimental effects on health.

Moving on to our next story, a group of researchers from Pennsylvania State University in the United States have investigated the most effective beverages for hydration during summer. Contrary to popular belief, they found that sports drinks are not the most effective choice. Instead, they recommend drinking water or beverages with added electrolytes for optimal hydration during exercise or in hot environments. This research provides valuable insights for individuals looking to stay properly hydrated during the summer months.

In other news, several hardware manufacturers, including Sony and I-O Data, are planning to increase prices in August. The recent additional interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan has led to a stronger yen, but the exchange rate remains around 150 yen per dollar, indicating a weaker yen. Due to the rising costs of exchange rates and materials, these hardware manufacturers have decided to implement price adjustments. This includes a range of hardware products, and customers should expect higher prices in the near future.

Moving on, Panasonic Connect has announced the establishment of a new company in partnership with Orix in the business projector industry. This strategic move aims to strengthen their position in the market and ensure the continuity of their brand. By collaborating with Orix, Panasonic Connect aims to enhance their business projector offerings and provide innovative solutions to their customers.

In tech news, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has announced the discontinuation of new registrations for services such as AWS Cloud9 and AWS CodeCommit. AWS Evangelist Jeff Barr revealed this decision on July 31st, stating that these services will no longer accept new users. AWS will continue to support existing users of these services, but no further new registrations will be accepted. This decision aligns with AWS's focus on optimizing and streamlining their service offerings.

Shifting gears, NTT Docomo has unveiled a new plan called 'eximo Point Activity Plan' aimed at expanding the usage of their d-card credit card. Starting from August 1st, customers who use the d-card linked to this plan will receive increased 'd-points' and can earn up to 5,000 points per month. NTT Docomo's Marketing Strategy Department Manager, Akihiro Yamamoto, emphasizes that this plan is recommended for everyone and aims to provide benefits to a wide range of customers.

Lastly, the National Consumer Affairs Center of Japan has issued a warning about a scam called '〇〇 Pay Refund Fraud' that exploits the name of the center. Scammers send messages claiming to refund the purchase amount and deceive people into providing their payment information through QR code payment services. The center has observed an increase in reports of such fraudulent activities and advises the public to exercise caution and be aware of these scams.
