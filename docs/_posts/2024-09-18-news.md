Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on September 18th, 2024. Today, we start with some exciting news for iPhone users. The recent update to iOS 18 has introduced a new feature called ‘swipe input’ for Japanese language users. This enhancement allows for faster and more intuitive typing, making it easier to communicate on the go. Users are already buzzing about the improvements on social media, highlighting how this could change the way they interact with their devices.

In the gaming world, Granblue Fantasy has had to implement emergency maintenance due to a glitch that allowed players to easily obtain a rare item known as the 'Pure Axe Soul.' This item is typically very difficult to acquire, so the developers took immediate action to rectify the situation and ensure a fair gaming experience for all players.

Shifting gears to online shopping, Amazon has announced its upcoming 'Prime Day' event, set to kick off on October 19th. This sale will offer over a million items at special prices for Prime members over a 48-hour period. It's an exciting time for online shoppers looking to snag some deals.

In a rather humorous turn of events, a strange entry appeared on the Japanese Microsoft website, referring to a 'Microsoft Copilot Adoption Kit.' This seems to be a translation error, sparking a wave of jokes on social media about the idea of forming a familial bond with AI. Users are having a good laugh, imagining a world where AI and humans could be connected in such a way.

On the tech investment front, AI startup Sakana AI has successfully raised approximately 30 billion yen in Series A funding, with contributions from major Japanese companies like NEC and Fujitsu. This follows a recent funding round where they secured about 14.5 billion yen from NVIDIA, showcasing the growing interest in AI technologies in Japan.

In product safety news, Anker Japan has announced a voluntary recall of two mobile battery products after two fire incidents occurred overseas. While there have been no reported incidents in Japan, the company is taking precautionary measures by halting sales and initiating a recall and exchange program for the affected items.

Lastly, a significant data breach has occurred at doda, a recruitment service, where the personal information of nearly 55,000 hiring managers became accessible to 1,164 agencies. This incident raises concerns about data security and the protection of sensitive information in the recruitment industry.
